TAKE THIS KISS UPON THE BROW!
AND, IN PARTING FROM YOU NOW,
THUS MUCH LET ME AVOW--
YOU ARE NOT WRONG, WHO DEEM
THAT MY DAYS HAVE BEEN A DREAM;
YET IF HOPE HAS FLOWN AWAY
IN A NIGHT, OR IN A DAY,
IN A VISION, OR IN NONE,
IS IT THEREFORE THE LESS GONE?
ALL THAT WE SEE OR SEEM
IS BUT A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.
